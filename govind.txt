   - Machine type: e2-micro
   - Username set as: govindp1418@task13
   - Added SSH key for authentication
   - Enabled firewall rules for SSH (22) and ICMP (ping)
   - Launched the VM successfully

   - Checked network configuration using:
     ip a

5. From within the VM:
   - Fetched its own public IP using:
